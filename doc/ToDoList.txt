virginia-tech-20170810 : To Do List

- Upgrade all other npm packages to the latest versions, if possible
- Lint the .js code
- Run NSP (a Node.js security scan) via "grunt nsp"
- Responsive Web design: Use Bootstrap class prefixes "col-sm-" and "col-md-" in additon to the currently-used "col-lg-" to format the view for different screen sizes
- TODO: Angular: Use ng-repeat (or whatever it is called (*ngFor)) to create tags for each sidebar group via iteration?
	<li><a href="#"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-folder"></i> X With Natl Avgs</a></li>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<!-- <li ng-repeat="x in columnsInNationalAverageGroupWithLabels"><a ui-sref="home({ analysis: '{{x.analysis}}' })"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-file-o"></i> {{x.label}}</a></li> -->
			<li ng-repeat="x in columnsInNationalAverageGroupWithLabels"><a ui-sref="home({ analysis: x.analysis })"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-file-o"></i> {{ x.label }}</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>

**** Other Notes ****

- Virginia Tech Web App for the Presentation on Thursday:
	* TODO: Login with username and password both equal to "vtuser"
	* TODO: Import the .csv data into MongoDB
		- Create an "Upload and ingest .csv" page? -> Currently using the script ingest.js
	* TODO: Integrate Chart.js
	* TODO: Get one use case working: Data in MongoDB -> Data in a controller -> Analysis: Slice and dice the numbers -> Generate a pretty chart -> Amaze the audience -> Profit!
	~ TODO: Populate the sidebar (see app/index.html) with all of the analyses specified in the Word doc
		* Use a URL parameter to choose the type of analysis: index.html?analysis=studentrace
	- TODO: Write the outline for your presentation!
		- MEAN + Bootstrap
		- Authentication and authorization
		- Hideable sidebar
		- Services
		- .less -> .css
		- Grunt watch ?
	* TODO: Use services so you can show them off (present them). Modularity and reusability are good.
	* TODO: Generate CSS from LESS via Grunt rather than Gulp
	* TODO: Ensure that the (moving) sidebar doesn't mess up any aspect of the views
	- TODO: Make the Web app Responsive! Bootstrap lg/md/sm ? Test with different browser window widths.
	- TODO: Ensure that the app passes Lint (so you can demo the Linting process during the presentation).
	- TODO: Research the appearance of presentations made by members of Abhay's department at VT; make my presentation consistent.
	* TODO: Change Web app colour to match VT's colours: See their Website
	* TODO: From the spec: "The dashboard application should provide select feature to help visualize the information by institution."
		? What should this "select feature" do from the user's point of view?
			-> ! The tooltip feature already works automagically (!!!), thanks to angular-chart.js
	* TODO: From the spec: "The dataset has national average data for some of the data fields. Please use that data to provide comparative measures in visualization (eg: % Graduation rate: National average v/s Institution)."
		- ? Factor out the "National Average..." columns into a separate collection?
		// 'National Average Annual Cost',
			-> Relates to the column(s) : 'Average Annual Cost'
		// 'National Average Students Paying Down Their Debt (%)',
			-> Relates to the column(s) : 'Students Paying Down Their Debt (%)'
		// 'National Average - Salary After Attending',
			-> Relates to the column(s) : 'Salary After Attending ($)'
		// 'National Average - Graduation rate (%)',
			-> Relates to the column(s) : ? 'Completion rate for first-time and full-time students at four-year institutions'
		// 'National Average - First-time, full-time student retention rate at four-year institutions (%)'
			-> Relates to the column(s) : 'First-time, full-time student retention rate at four-year institutions (%)'
	- TODO: Determine chart type (bar vs. line vs. pie) for each column or related group of columns:
		Bar: '25th percentile of SAT scores at the institution (critical reading)',
		Bar: '75th percentile of SAT scores at the institution (critical reading)',
		Bar: '25th percentile of SAT scores at the institution (math)',
		Bar: '75th percentile of SAT scores at the institution (math)',
		Bar: '25th percentile of SAT scores at the institution (writing)',
		Bar: '75th percentile of SAT scores at the institution (writing)',
		Bar: 'Midpoint of SAT scores at the institution (critical reading)',
		Bar: 'Midpoint of SAT scores at the institution (math)',
		Bar: 'Midpoint of SAT scores at the institution (writing)',
		Bar: '25th percentile of the ACT cumulative score',
		Bar: '75th percentile of the ACT cumulative score',
		Pie: Percentage of degrees awarded in each category of study, including "Other"
			- Make the pie chart big enough, since it will have a lot of slices
			Bar: 'Percentage of degrees awarded in Agriculture, Agriculture Operations, And Related Sciences',
			Bar: 'Percentage of degrees awarded in Natural Resources And Conservation',
			Bar: 'Percentage of degrees awarded in Architecture And Related Services',
			Bar: 'Percentage of degrees awarded in Communication, Journalism, And Related Programs',

			Bar: '% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander',
			Bar: '% Two or More races',
			Exclude this one??? Bar: '% Non Resident Alien',
			Bar: '% Unknown',
			? Bar: '% Other'
	* TODO: Fix the position of the SAT sub-folders in the sidebar; at the moment, they are sibling folders (not sub-folders) of the SAT folder.
	* TODO: ! Correctly handle NULL values (e.g. in the ACT scores)
		* What happens if we call e.g. parseFloat/parseInt('NULL') or parseFloat/parseInt(null) ?
	* TODO: Prevent the sidebar (when it is visible) from disabling the click and hover events on the rest of the page (especially the chart)
	- TODO: ? Make the sidebar always visible?
	- TODO: ? Make the chart bigger?
	* TODO: For special cases, handle all institutions, not just institutions[0]. -> Show (vs. hide (ng-if)) a dropdown of all institution names; the selected name will determine n in institutions[n].
	* TODO: In percentage charts, round amounts to 2 (?) decimal points?
	* TODO: SAT: 5 groups of 3 bars (25 pct, 75 pct, median)
	* TODO: Label the Y axes of the bar charts
	- Note: This is a *single page* dashboard-style Web app; no need for multiple pages (or multiple controllers?)
